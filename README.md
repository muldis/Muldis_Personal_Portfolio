# Muldis Skill Demos

This repository features multiple typically independent projects, each of
which is intended more to publicly demonstrate that I have experience with
a range of technologies, rather than being intended to actually be used in
industry, in contrast with the typical other Muldis repository.

You are still free to actually use these if they would be useful to you,
as with any open source project, but they are not intended to actually
contribute capabilities that don't already exist elsewhere.

## Muldis Application Inventory (MULDIS-APPINV)

[Muldis_Application_Inventory](Muldis_Application_Inventory)

MULDIS-APPINV is a simple web-based database application that
empowers an organization to track and manage applications that they are
developing, tracking details for each such as its product title, start
date, and names of people in various roles; it supports listing, viewing,
adding, editing, and removing product records.

Technologies used include:

- TypeScript (<https://typescriptlang.org>)
- Node.js (<https://nodejs.org>)
- Nest.js (<https://nestjs.com>)
- Express.js (<https://expressjs.com>)
- React.js (<https://react.dev>)
- JSON (<https://json.org>)
- REST APIs / Swagger
- MERN stack (modified)
