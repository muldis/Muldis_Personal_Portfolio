# Muldis Application Inventory: WEBAPP: CRA (MULDIS-APPINV-WEBAPP-CRA)

This document describes MULDIS-APPINV-WEBAPP-CRA,
which is a concrete implementation of the abstract WEBAPP
component of the abstract MULDIS-APPINV application.
It is built in the TypeScript language using the Create React App framework
using the React web library.

MULDIS-APPINV is a simple web-based database application that empowers an
organization to track and manage applications that they are developing,
tracking details for each such as its product title, start date, and names
of people in various roles; it supports listing, viewing, adding, editing,
and removing product records.

MULDIS-APPINV has the 2 components DBMS and WEBAPP, such that the latter is
what end users typically interact with directly using a generic web
browser, and the former is a supporting service providing a RESTful API
that the latter consumes.

Each of DBMS and WEBAPP is abstract and can have multiple alternative
concrete implementations, each one built with a different technology.
