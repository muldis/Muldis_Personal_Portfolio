# Muldis Academia: DBMS: Laravel (MULDIS-ACAD-DBMS-LARA)

This document describes MULDIS-ACAD-DBMS-LARA,
which is a concrete implementation of the abstract DBMS
component of the abstract MULDIS-ACAD application.
It is built in the PHP language using the Laravel web framework.

MULDIS-ACAD is a simple web-based database application that empowers an
academic organization to manage student data.

MULDIS-ACAD has the 2 components DBMS and WEBAPP, such that the latter is
what end users typically interact with directly using a generic web
browser, and the former is a supporting service providing a RESTful API
that the latter consumes.

Each of DBMS and WEBAPP is abstract and can have multiple alternative
concrete implementations, each one built with a different technology.
