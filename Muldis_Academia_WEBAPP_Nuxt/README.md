# Muldis Academia: WEBAPP: NUXT (MULDIS-ACAD-WEBAPP-NUXT)

This document describes MULDIS-ACAD-WEBAPP-NUXT,
which is a concrete implementation of the abstract WEBAPP
component of the abstract MULDIS-ACAD application.
It is built in the TypeScript language using the Nuxt and Vue web frameworks.

MULDIS-ACAD is a simple web-based database application that empowers an
academic organization to manage student data.

MULDIS-ACAD has the 2 components DBMS and WEBAPP, such that the latter is
what end users typically interact with directly using a generic web
browser, and the former is a supporting service providing a RESTful API
that the latter consumes.

Each of DBMS and WEBAPP is abstract and can have multiple alternative
concrete implementations, each one built with a different technology.

## Contents

**The rest of this documentation still has to be written.**

MULDIS-ACAD-WEBAPP-NUXT is a work in progress.
It is not yet ready to use for its intended purpose, nor is it yet even a
minimum viable product.
The current version supports viewing a list of students, which works now,
but the web user interface for adding/editing/removing students has yet to
be added, though the corresponding MULDIS-ACAD-DBMS-LARA API does currently
implement all of that functionality too and could be used with a tool like
Postman in the meantime.  The missing UI is expected to be added very soon.
